  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <p><span class="highlight">d3.unconf</span> is a one-day gathering of data visualization practitioners. We're meeting to catalyze involvement and knowledge sharing within the <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> and greater visualization community.</p>

    <p>We want this 1 day event to be as productive and fun as possible. We are limiting attendance to people who are serious about being members of this dynamic community.
    To that en we expect every attendee to have at least tried to make a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org">block</a>. 
    If you are serious and haven't made one yet, check out <a href="http://blockbuilder.org/about">block builder</a> to get started!</p>
    <p>Check out <a href="/d3unconf2014">last year's conference</a> to get an idea of what to expect!</p>
